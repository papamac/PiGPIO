## Initial GitHub release v1.0.0, April 15, 2024 ##

This is the initial version of the Pi GPIO plugin for Indigo. It is fully
functional and documented in README.md and the GitHub wiki.

The wiki [Design section](https://github.com/papamac/PiGPIO/wiki/3.-Design) is
incomplete in this version. There is, however, adequate user information
in the [Plugin Configuration](https://github.com/papamac/PiGPIO/wiki/4.-Plugin-Configuration)
and [Pi Cookbook](https://github.com/papamac/PiGPIO/wiki/5.-Pi-Cookbook)
sections for most applications. Also, detailed design documentation is included in
the code comments and docstrings. Future GitHub releases will augment this with
a more complete high-level design discussion in the Design section.

The activation sensor feature that was implemented in version 0.9.1 is no
longer supported because of its limited usefulness.
